# Battleship

## Environment Setup

This project is built using Aurelia and Node.js, and it can be deployed using ZEIT. Here's how you can get started using each of these technologies:

### Node.js

If you're using a Mac, I recommend installing Node.js using Homebrew with the following command:  
`brew install node`

Otherwise, you can install Node.js in the environment of your choosing following the instructions found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Aurelia

Once you have Node.js installed, you'll be able to install the Aurelia CLI using the following command:  
`npm install -g aurelia-cli`
